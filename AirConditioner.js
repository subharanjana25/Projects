      <h3 className="ac-tip-title">1. Clean or Replace the Air Filter on a Regular Basis</h3>
      <p className="ac-tip-text">
        When your air conditioning system exceeds the threshold of air circulation, it will run at peak performance. Conversely, if the air filters are clogged and unclean, the overall efficiency drops considerably. When the filters are dusty, the quality of air in your house also drops, and the circulation is drastically reduced, necessitating the system to function longer and harder.
      </p>
      <p className="ac-tip-text">
        If this is the situation, the filters need to be changed. It is generally recommended that the filters be cleaned (or replaced) every 3 months to improve the air conditioner’s cooling significantly.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ac-tip-title">2. Tightly Latch All Doors and Windows</h3>
      <p className="ac-tip-text">
        Leaving windows and doors even partly open while using your air conditioner can easily cause cold air to leak outside. This can negatively impact the system’s performance over time. To ensure optimal cooling, make sure all windows and doors are shut tightly.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ac-tip-title">3. Install a Cover to Safeguard Your Outdoor Unit</h3>
      <p className="ac-tip-text">
        Even the hot outdoor temperature can significantly impact your outdoor unit’s efficiency in cooling your home. To help prevent strain and reduce the risk of damage, install some shade over the unit. However, make sure the shade doesn’t block airflow in any way.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ac-tip-title">4. Ensure All of the AC’s Components are Clean</h3>
      <p className="ac-tip-text">
        For optimal performance, keep the exterior unit of your AC system as clean as possible by removing dirt. Cleaning the condenser coil can be tricky and time-consuming, so be sure you understand the process before you begin. If you’re unsure, you can simply call an air conditioner service technician and get it cleaned.
      </p>
      <p className="ac-tip-text">
        It’s also critical to regularly clean and clear your vents to prevent dust buildup. Clogged vents can force your system to work harder, leading to higher electricity bills.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ac-tip-title">5. Repair Any Cracks or Leaks in Your Home</h3>
      <p className="ac-tip-text">
        The prevalence of leaks throughout your house is a major cause of your AC system’s reduced efficiency. Leaky ducts allow the cool air you pay for to escape, forcing the system to work harder, causing your power bill to rise.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ac-tip-title">6. Thoroughly Examine the Condensate Drain</h3>
      <p className="ac-tip-text">
        The condensate drain is a critical component within your air conditioning system. Its primary function is to remove accumulated moisture during operation. A clogged condensate drain can impede this process, leading to water accumulation around the AC unit. If you observe this issue, it’s recommended to contact a qualified AC technician for inspection and potential cleaning.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ac-tip-title">7. Sizing up Your AC: Right Fit for the Room</h3>
      <p className="ac-tip-text">
        One of the most important cooling AC tips is to ensure that the device is neither excessively small nor overly large for your room. If your air conditioner is insufficient for the size of your space, it will not function adequately and will run for lengthy periods, increasing your monthly power cost substantially.

      <h3 className="ac-tip-title">8. Keep the Fins Straight</h3>
      <p className="ac-tip-text">
        The outdoor unit has delicate fins that help cool the air. If these fins get bent, airflow is reduced, making your AC work harder. You can straighten minor bends with a fin comb, but in case of extensive damage, call a professional technician and get the issue checked.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ac-tip-title">9. Check Insulation</h3>
      <p className="ac-tip-text">
        To ensure your air conditioner runs efficiently, regularly check the insulation around the copper pipes. This foam rubber material, typically black or white, insulates the refrigerant lines between the indoor and outdoor units.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ac-tip-title">10. Schedule Yearly Maintenance</h3>
      <p className="ac-tip-text">
        Just like your car, your AC benefits from regular professional maintenance. Ideally, have a qualified technician inspect and service your system at least once a year before the start of summer to ensure optimal performance and prevent potential problems. Scheduling these services may involve minor service charges, but it will save you money on expensive repairs down the road as well as electricity bills, and undoubtedly help extend the lifespan of your AC.
