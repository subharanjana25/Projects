        Refrigerator coils are the most vulnerable part of the home appliance. Keeping it in perfect condition will surely eliminate the requirements of more than 70% of fridge repair service calls. Go through this process and you will not need to call your repair technician. You pay your utility company Rs 350 to 700 a month for the refrigerator not working efficiently. If you take care of the recommended maintenance tasks regularly, you can expect years of loyal service from your refrigerator. However, there is more that you can do to make sure it is efficient and has a fresh scent. In case your refrigerator is smelling bad, you can use an open box of baking soda to absorb the unpleasant odors.

      <h3 className="section-title">2. Maintain the right temperature</h3>
      <p className="section-text">
        Check the cooling temperature often in the refrigerator and freezer of your unit.
        It's important for food security and to help the refrigerator run efficiently.
        The inside temperature of the refrigerator must be around -4 to 0℃. This temperature might vary sometimes which is quite normal, but you must check that does not affect the functioning of the refrigerator. If you feel that your refrigerator is not maintaining the appropriate temperature, you can reset the thermostat setting and likely the problem will be solved. If not, then you need to call a professional refrigerator repair service, or you can also search "my refrigerator is not cooling" for guidance to the right fridge servicing.
      </p>

      <h3 className="section-title">3. Organize Your Fridge</h3>
      <p className="section-text">
        Keeping your fridge organized can help with airflow and efficiency. Avoid overcrowding and store similar items together. This not only helps you find things quickly but also prevents temperature fluctuations.

        If your fridge has a lot of frost buildup, it can affect cooling. Make it a routine to defrost your fridge if you notice excessive frost, ideally every few months, to maintain optimal performance.

      <h3 className="section-title">5. Never use sharp objects</h3>
      <p className="section-text">
        Sharp objects like knives may damage the interior and can even lead to gas leakage, which would cost you heavily. Refrigerant leakage in the fridge is a serious problem. You can avoid that by being watchful and careful. If ever you encounter a situation where something gets stuck in the refrigerator (which happens most of the time if the freezer temperature is too cold), you can take it out by switching off the refrigerator for a while.

      <h3 className="section-title">6. Never keep hot food in the refrigerator</h3>
