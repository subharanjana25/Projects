      <h3 className="section-title">1. Clean the Filters Regularly</h3>

        alt="Cleaning Filters"
      />
      <p className="section-text">
        Washing machines come with filters that catch lint, dirt, coins, buttons, etc. If these filters clog up, it can reduce water flow and affect cleaning performance. Make it a habit to check and clean out the filters every 2 weeks.
      </p>

      <p className="section-text">
        Top load machines usually have an easily removable round magic filter at the bottom of the tub. For front load machines, the filters are typically behind a cover on the lower front panel. Remove any built-up fluff or particles and rinse thoroughly before putting it back.
      </p>

      <h3 className="section-title">2. Leave the Door Open After Use</h3>
      <p className="section-text">
        After you finish using the washing machine for the day, leave the door open to allow air circulation inside the washer tub. This allows any lingering moisture to evaporate and prevents the growth of mold and mildew which causes unpleasant odors. Make sure to wipe the door gasket as well using an old towel to absorb excess moisture.
      </p>

      <h3 className="section-title">3. Run a Hot Rinse Cycle Monthly</h3>
      <p className="section-text">
        Mineral deposits from hard water and soap scum build-ups inside the machine can lead to clogging and staining over time. Monthly, run an empty hot rinse cycle with either vinegar or a descaling powder. This will help dissolve any mineral deposits and clean out residual detergent, keeping the interiors fresh.
      </p>

      <p className="section-text">
        For top load machines, fill the detergent compartment with 200 ml of white vinegar and run a full hot cycle. For front load machines, use specialized descaling powders as per the instructions. This regular hot rinse prevents mineral build-up, helping improve the lifespan of the pipes and valves.
      </p>

      <h3 className="section-title">4. Clean Out the Dispenser Drawer</h3>
      <img

        alt="Cleaning Dispenser Drawer"
      />
      <p className="section-text">
        Don’t neglect the detergent and fabric softener dispenser drawer while cleaning your machine. Leftover gunk from detergents and residue from fabric softeners/bleaches can clog the valves. Remove the drawer by pressing the release latch and pull it out completely.
      </p>
      <p className="section-text">
        Rinse the drawer under running water to dissolve stuck-on residue. Use an old toothbrush to loosen buildup and clean the nooks. Rinse and replace it back in the slot. Also, wipe down the panel using a diluted bleach solution, avoiding electrical parts. This keeps any slime mold from accumulating.
      </p>

      <h3 className="section-title">5. Inspect the Drain Hose</h3>
      <p className="section-text">
        Check that the drain hose at the back of the machine is positioned correctly to ensure there are no leaks or overflow. As a precaution against leaks or backflow of dirty water, you can purchase anti-flood devices. These will automatically cut off water flow if the hose level rises above the permissible limit.
      </p>
      <p className="section-text">
        While you’re there, examine the drain hose for cracks or mold spots which indicate early signs of wear and tear. Replace defective parts right away to prevent accidents and water damage.
      </p>

      <h3 className="section-title">6. Level Out Uneven Legs</h3>

        alt="Leveling Legs"
      />
      <p className="section-text">
        Over time, washing machine legs may become uneven. Adjust them using a leveling tool to prevent excessive rocking during spins.
      </p>
      <p className="section-text">
        Twist out each leg at the base manually or use pliers to adjust the legs until the bubble is centered, indicating an even flat surface. Ideally, for stability, no leg should have more than a 1-inch gap under it. This prevents “walking” and also reduces noise and vibration issues.
      </p>

      <h3 className="section-title">7. Clean Exterior and Detergent Drawer</h3>
      <img
        className="section-image"

        alt="Cleaning Exterior"
      />
      <p className="section-text">
        Use a damp cloth to wipe down the exterior cabinet and control panels to prevent dirt accumulation. Avoid harsh chemicals; all-purpose cleaners diluted in water work fine for occasional cleaning. Pay special attention to the gasket and detergent drawer area, which are prone to staining.
      </p>
      <p className="section-text">
        Check the power cord and plug points to make sure they are not overheating. Unplug the machine and clean out the socket inlet and the prongs using a dry cloth. Any dirt buildup can lead to electrocution hazards.
